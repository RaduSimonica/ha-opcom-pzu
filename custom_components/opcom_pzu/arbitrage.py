"""Battery arbitrage planner.

Given buy/sell prices per interval, find the charge/discharge schedule that
maximises net profit for a battery with limited capacity and power.

Economics of one kWh delivered to the grid, charged earlier at price ``b`` and
sold at ``s``::

    net = s - degradation - b / round_trip_efficiency

so a pair is only worth cycling when ``s - degradation > b / efficiency``.
The planner is a dynamic programme over a discretised state of charge, which
handles capacity and power limits and multiple cycles per day. The battery
starts with ``initial_kwh`` (default empty) and may end at any level; energy
left over at the end is worth nothing, so nothing is bought just to sit there.
Energy already in the battery counts as free, as its cost is sunk.
